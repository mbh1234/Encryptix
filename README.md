# Encryptix Internship Projects

This repository contains the two projects completed as part of the internship program at Encryptix.

## Project 1: Sales Prediction Using Python

### Objective
Predict future sales of a company using historical sales data.

### Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Gathered and cleaned historical sales data
   - Encoding categorical variables

2. **Time Series Analysis:**
   - Analyzed trends, seasonality, and cyclic patterns

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Created features like moving averages, lagged features, rolling statistics

4. **Model Building:**
   - Explored ARIMA, Prophet, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting models

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE
   - Fine-tuning the best model

6. **Deployment:**
   - Developed a pipeline for continuous prediction updates
   - Visualizations and dashboards for stakeholders

## Project 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Objective
Detect fraudulent credit card transactions to prevent financial losses and protect customers.

### Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Used a dataset of credit card transactions
   - Addressed data imbalance with SMOTE and other techniques

2. **Handling Imbalanced Data:**
   - Applied oversampling and undersampling

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Created features to capture transaction patterns
   - Scaling and normalization

4. **Model Building:**
   - Tested models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC-ROC
   - Focused on minimizing false negatives

6. **Implementation:**
   - Real-time transaction monitoring and flagging suspicious activities
   - System for ongoing model updates and retraining
